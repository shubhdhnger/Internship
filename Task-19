Task-19
1.Create an interface Shape with an abstract method calculateArea().
2.Create an abstract class Rectangle that implements Shape.
It should have two protected instance variables: width and height.
It should have a constructor that takes width and height as arguments.
3.Create an anonymous class that extends Rectangle and provides the implementation for the calculateArea() method.
4.Create a nested static class Circle within the Rectangle class that implements Shape.
It should have a private instance variable radius.
It should have a constructor that takes radius as an argument.
It should provide the implementation for the calculateArea() method.
5.Create a main class to:
Create an instance of the anonymous Rectangle class.
Create an instance of the Rectangle.Circle class.
Print the areas of both shapes.

interface Shape {
    double calculateArea();
}

//  abstract class Rectangle that implements Shape
abstract class Rectangle implements Shape {
    protected double width;
    protected double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    // Nested static class Circle within Rectangle that implements Shape
    public static class Circle implements Shape {
        private double radius;

        public Circle(double radius) {
            this.radius = radius;
        }

        @Override
        public double calculateArea() {
            return Math.PI * radius * radius;
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //  anonymous class extending Rectangle
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10) {
            @Override
            public double calculateArea() {
                return width * height;
            }
        };

        // instance of the nested Circle class
        Rectangle.Circle circle = new Rectangle.Circle(7);

        // Print the areas
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle with width 5 and height 10: " + rectangle.calculateArea());
        System.out.println("Area of Circle with radius 7: " + circle.calculateArea());
    }
}
